# Efficient Globally Optimal 2D-to-3D Deformable Shape Matching

Implementation of "Efficient Globally Optimal 2D-to-3D Deformable Shape Matching" (Zorah LÃ¤hner, Emanuele Rodola, Frank R. Schmidt, Michael M. Bronstein and Daniel Cremers, International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016)

The code is mainly written in C++ with a Matlab mex wrapper. It will compile automatically when running but you might need link your correct C++ compiler in Matlab.
A precompiled version for Linux systems is included (just commented out the mex line). 

You can download the entire data used for generating the results as well the pdf and the bibtex entry here:
